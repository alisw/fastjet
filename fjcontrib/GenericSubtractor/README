GenericSubtractor is part of the fastjet-contrib project.

The GenericSubtractor class allows one to subtract pile-up
contamination from jet shapes as described in

The code example.cc illustrates how to use the class in a simple case.
It can be built using

    make example

example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
/data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example.ref

A more advanced example (shapes made up of several components) is
given in example_with_components.cc, which can be built and run with 

    make example_with_components
   ./example_with_components < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat

and compared to the expected output example_with_components.ref
