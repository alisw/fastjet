	* NEWS:
	release of version 1.0.1

	* README: 
	updated to reflect v1.0 interface.

2013-05-01  Jesse Thaler

	* EnergyCorrelator.cc
	Switched from NAN to std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN()

2013-04-30  Jesse Thaler

	* EnergyCorrelator.cc
	Implemented Gregory Soyez's suggestions on errors/asserts

	* VERSION:
	* NEWS:
	released v. 1.0.0

	* EnergyCorrelator.hh:
	* example.cc
	small changes to documentation to reflect the change below + an
	gave an explicit command-line in the example.

2013-04-29 Jesse Thaler

	* EnergyCorrelator.cc
	- Added support for N = 5

	* example.cc|.ref
	- Added N = 5 to test suite.

	* EnergyCorrelator.hh|cc:
	- reduced memory usage from roughly 8n^2 to 4n^2 bytes (note that
	  sums are now performed in a different order, so results may
	  change to within rounding error).

	- Implemented description() for all three classes.

	- Worked on doxygen-style comments and moved some bits of code into
	  the .cc file.

	* Doxyfile:  *** ADDED ***

	* example.cc:
	developers' timing component now uses clock(), to get
	finer-grained timing, and also outputs a description for some of
	the correlators being used.

2013-04-26 + 04-27 Jesse Thaler <jthaler@MIT.EDU>

	* EnergyCorrelator.hh|cc:
	added temporary storage array for interparticle angles, to speed
	up the energy correlator calculation for N>2

        * example.cc
	has internal option for printing out timing info.

2013-04-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch> + Jesse & Andrew

	* Makefile:
	added explicit dependencies

	* example.cc (analyze):
	added a little bit of commented code for timing tests.
