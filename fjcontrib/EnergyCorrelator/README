The EnergyCorrelator package is based on the physics described in:

   Energy Correlation Functions for Jet Substructure.
   Andrew J. Larkoski, Gavin Salam, and Jesse Thaler.
   arXiv:1305.xxxx.

This FastJet-contrib package contains three classes derived from
FunctionOfPseudoJet<double> :

EnergyCorrelator(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called ECF(N,beta) in the publication.  Corresponds to the N-point
  correlation function, with beta the angular exponent, while measure
  = pt_R (default) or E_theta sets how energies and angles are
  determined.

EnergyCorrelatorRatio(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called r_N^(beta) in the publication.  
  Equals ECF(N+1,beta)/ECF(N,beta).

EnergyCorrelatorDoubleRatio(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called C_N^(beta) in the publication.  Equals r_N/r_{N-1}.  This is
  the recommended function for boosted N-prong object discrimination.
  (N=1 for quark/gluon, N=2 for boosted W/Z/H, N=3 for boosted top)

Usage is shown in the example.cc program.
