Previous version history:
-- 0.5.1:  For Njettiness Plugin, added access to currentTau values and axes via
           ClusterSequence::Extras class.  (thanks to Dinko Ferencek and John Paul Chou)
-- 0.5.0:  Corrected fatal error in ConstituentTauValue (TauValue unaffected).
           Started process of allowing for more general measures and alternative minimization schemes.
           Extremely preliminary inclusion of alternative "geometric" measure.
-- 0.4.1:  Corrected bug where a too-small value of Rcut would cause the minimization
           procedure to fail (thanks Marat Freytsis, Brian Shuve)
-- 0.4.0:  Adding Nsubjettiness FunctionOfPseudoJet<float>.  Re-organizing file
           structure and doing some re-naming to clarify Njettiness vs.
           Nsubjettiness.  Some speedup in UpdateAxes code. (CKV)
-- 0.3.2:  Returns zero instead of a segmentation fault when the number of particles
           in a jet is smaller than the N value in tau_N (thanks Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.2:  Fixed -Wshadow errors (thanks Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.1:  Fixed stray comma/semicolon compiler error (thanks Grigory Ovanesyan)
-- 0.3.1:  Corrected tarbomb issue (thanks Jonathan Walsh)
-- 0.3.1:  Added anti-kT seeds as option
-- 0.3.1:  Fixed bug in minimization code with R_cutoff (thanks Chris Vermilion)
-- 0.3.1:  Added getPartition() and getJets() functions as helper functions for
           Chris Vermilion. (JT)
