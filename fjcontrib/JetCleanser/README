JetCleanser is part of the fastjet-contrib project.

The JetCleanser class allows one to cleanse a jet as described in

   Jet Cleansing: Pileup Removal at High Luminosity
   David Krohn, Matthew Low, Matthew D. Schwartz, and Lian-Tao Wang.
   arXiv:1309.4777

The code example.cc illustrates how to use the class in a simple case.

   make example

example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
/data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example.ref

Not currently supported (but may be added in the future):
   - areas after cleansing
   - information whether linear defaulted to JVF or not
